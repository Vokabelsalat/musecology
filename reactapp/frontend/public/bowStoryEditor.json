Such as to the changes from commonly small chamber music in front of small audiences to bigger symphony orchestras in large concert halls. F.X. Tourte was experimenting with new models and a variety of materials to adapt to the new requirements F.X. Tourte invented the modern string instrument bow around 1800 in Paris. He discovered the favourable wood characteristics of pau-brasil perfectly suitable and allowing the develpment of the modern bow model. In comparison to the until then typical baroque bow, the stick was not anymore concave it rather changed to a stick with a convex curve. A variety of materials of up to xx species from xxx countries have been used over history and/or are used today. The key part of a string instrument bow that is most important for the quality of a bow and for its characteristics while playing as well as for its sound characteristics is the bow stick.",

The rich Brazilian wildlife reflects the variety of natural habitats. However, today &frac23; of Brazilians populations lives along its coast, a sought-after location for humans but also for other living beings. The problem is that both require space for their survival. The Atlantic Forest, in Portuguese called Mata Atlântica, is exceptional with an extraordinary species richness including many species that are endemic to the Mata Atlântica, which means these species only occur within the Mata Atlântica. But at the same time it is one of the most threatened and degradaded forest ecosystems in the world. The combination of species richness and threatened ecosystem makes the Mata Atlântica a biodiversity hotspot, consisting of fifteen different ecoregions, including coastal and mountain areas.",
