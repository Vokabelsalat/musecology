It is the only country in the Americas to have Portuguese as an official language. It is one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations, due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world, and the most populous Roman Catholic-majority country.",

        Pau-brasil is even more picky and grows naturally only between Rio
        Grande do Norte and Rio de Janeiro, which means it is endemic to the
        Mata Atlântica biome. The emblematic and culturally important pau-brasil
        tree tells a bundle of stories - on one hand a story of social and
        cultural exploitation and on the other of music and culture. The beauty
        of its flowers with their sweet smell attracts bees and fascinates
        people.
