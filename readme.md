## Description

- MusEcology visualizes the interconnection between materials of musical instruments, their threat, appearance and the connection to their geographical distribution across the world supports responsible and sustainable decision-making processes.
- An holistic and transdisciplinary perspective on musical instruments and their materials is enabled by MusEcology, through four views connected to key biological, ecological aspects, and trade-relevant regulations.
